# DS Portfolio Project
**Creating a Data Science Portfolio Project from Start to Finish:**
_Data Acquisition, analysis, modeling, and presentation_

This talk will center around an example data science project that one might use to build a portfolio of work. A portfolio of data science projects can be useful in a number of different ways: to demonstrate your knowledge and practical skills to potential employers; to learn a new technology or methodology; or even as a way to have something to talk about at a PyData meetup!

I will walk through the different elements and techniques I used to develop this data science project in python including
* Web scraping and data acquisition with BeautifulSoup
* EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using Jupyter and Matplotlib
* Modeling with scikit-learn
* Showcasing the results with Flask
