# DS Portfolio Project
**Creating a Data Science Portfolio Project from Start to Finish:**
_Data Acquisition, analysis, modeling, and presentation_

This talk will center around an example data science project that one might use to start building a portfolio of work. A portfolio of data science projects can be useful in a number of different ways: to demonstrate your knowledge and practical skills to potential employers; to learn a new technology or methodology for your own growth and development; or even as a way to have something to talk about at a PyData meetup!

Since this talk is a day after the election in November, I will be using a number of different online sources to pull past election results and dive into some of the local elections both in King County and Washington State. Can we predict who will win between two candidates based purely on their candidate statement? What impact does spending have on the outcome? Are there other insights we can gain or questions we can ask of the data?

I will walk through the different elements and techniques I use to develop this data science project in python including

* Web scraping and data acquisition with BeautifulSoup
* EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) using Jupyter and Matplotlib
* Text analytics and modeling with scikit-learn
* Showcasing the results with Flask

All of the code will be made available prior to the event so that you may follow along or run on your own local machine. The talk is intended to be accessable to people of all skill levels!
